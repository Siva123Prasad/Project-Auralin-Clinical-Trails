# Project-Auralin-Clinical-Trails
  Our goal in this project is to conclude whether a new oral insulin, Auralin, is effective or not.
  
  We will come to a conlusion once we thoroughly analyse the available data and compare the change in HbA1c of Auralin with the existing insulin variety name Novodra.
